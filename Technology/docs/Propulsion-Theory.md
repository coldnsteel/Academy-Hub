## Position in the Flow Framework

Propulsion Theory is the **applied navigation layer** of the Universal Theory of Flow.

If the parent theory says: *"the universe is a knotted, folded flow-field with pre-existing topological architecture"* —

Then Propulsion Theory asks: *"how do we move through it efficiently by reading and aligning with that architecture?"*

## Core Principle

> Don't generate thrust against the flow. **Read the topology. Ride the hierarchy.**

Just as a genetic program aligns with chromatin folding — and a building's circulation aligns with its knot and fold diagram — propulsion at every scale becomes most efficient when it exploits pre-existing flow structure rather than fighting it.

## Three Propulsion Regimes

### 1. Micro-scale (Biological)
- Molecular motors (kinesin, myosin) walk along pre-folded cytoskeletal tracks
- Flagella exploit fluid topology — low Reynolds number flow is *navigated*, not pushed through
- Implication: design propulsion that follows the knot/fold grammar of its medium

### 2. Meso-scale (Engineering)
- Deployable structures that unfold along pre-scripted fold lines
- Soft robots using slip-knot-like actuators — tighten under load, release when threshold crossed
- Architectured materials where propulsion force is distributed via fold topology, not point thrust

### 3. Macro-scale (Cosmic)
- Gravitational slingshots — exploit space-time fold geometry (curvature as fold line)
- Magnetic reconnection harvesting — target slip-knot loci where field topology flips and energy releases
- Cosmic web surfing — ride filament flows rather than crossing void against gradient
- Solar sail + field-line alignment — propulsion by topological alignment, not fuel burn

## Navigation Toolkit (from Flow Framework)

| Tool | What it reads | What it enables |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Knot mapping** | Global connectivity of flows | Which paths are open, crossed, or trapped |
| **Fold charting** | Gradient fields (gravity, EM, pressure) | Which directions are downhill in flow space |
| **Slip detection** | Reconnection zones, phase boundaries | Gates between flow regimes — transition points |
| **Nested structure** | Hierarchy of scales | Which level of flow to ride at any moment |

## Open Questions

- Can slip-knot-like mechanisms be engineered into spacecraft attitude control?
- What is the minimum topological map needed to navigate a jet from an accretion disk?
- Can biological propulsion (cilia, flagella) topological grammar be directly translated to micro-robotics?
